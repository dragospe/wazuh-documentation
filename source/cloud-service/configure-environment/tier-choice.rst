The amount of data that a Wazuh Cloud Service user can conveniently visualize on WUI is limited to a specific amount for the last month. Data for the last year will be kept compressed as cold storage, being able to retrieve it with no storage limits for that period of time.

To fit the environment demands, the proper tier can be selected. Some of the tiers include:

100GB 250GB 500GB 1TB 1TB+
