Manage WUI access
=================

When an environment is created you are granted access to its WUI to interact with it. More users can be added to access the WUI besides the administrator.

Granting WUI access to others
-----------------------------

1. :ref:`Log into your WUI<cloud_getting_started_wui_access>` as administrator.

2. Choose **Security**, **Internal Users**, and **Create internal user**.

3. Provide a username and password. The security plugin automatically hashes the password and stores it.

4. If desired, specify user attributes.

5. Choose **Submit**.
