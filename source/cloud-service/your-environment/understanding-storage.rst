Understanding storage
=====================

.. meta::
  :description: Learn about your tier choice. 

Your environment will let you visualize online on your WUI a certain amount of data that matches your tier. If the environment's data exceeds the tier the oldest data will be rotated. Which means that it will not be accessible online through the WUI.

However, even if the environment's storage surpasses the tier, that data will still be accessible as offline data for a year without size limits.

To fit the environment demands, the proper tier can be selected. Some of the tiers include:

- 100GB

- 250GB

- 500GB

- 1TB

- 1TB+
