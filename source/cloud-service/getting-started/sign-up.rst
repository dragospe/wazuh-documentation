To experience the benefits of Wazuh Cloud, start by signing up for a Trial

1. Sign up on Wazuh Cloud.

2. Create an :ref:`environment <cloud_glossary_environment>`.

   1. Select a name for the environment.

   2. Select a :ref:`tier <cloud_glossary_tier>`: Total size (in GB) of the alerts which are available online. This `estimation tool <https://wazuh.com/cloud/#pricing>`_ may be helpful to calculate it.

   3.  Select your :ref:`region <cloud_glossary_region>`.

3. View the summary and confirm

4. A pop-up will show you your environment's credentials, keep them safe as them as they will be used in later interactions with your environment (Agent registration and report, and WUI access).

Trial will be free for 14 days. Once the trial period is over you will need to  :ref:`add your billing details <cloud_account_billing_details>` to keep using your environment.

When the trial has been properly created, next steps will be accessing the Wazuh WUI and registering the first agents.
