To experience the benefits of Wazuh Cloud, you should start by signing up for a Trial

1- Sign up on Wazuh Cloud.

2- Create an :ref:`environment <cloud_service_glossary>`.

2.1- Select a name for the environment.

2.2- Select a :ref:`tier <cloud_service_glossary>`: The amount of data available to check online. This `estimation tool <https://wazuh.com/cloud/#pricing>`_ may be helpful to calculate it.

2.3 - Select your :ref:`region <cloud_service_glossary>`.

3- You're all set! Check that your environment was properly created in the list.

Trial will be free for 14 days, but you may keep using your environment since that moment by adding billing details.

Once the trial has been properly created, next steps will be accessing the Wazuh WUI and registering the first agents.
