  :description: Learn how to get started with Wazuh Cloud Service

Wazuh Cloud Service is a great hosted EDR service which offers thread detection, integrity monitoring, incidence response and regulatory compliance among many other features. Wazuh Cloud Console is the convenient way to interact with this service.

Besides these features, a Cloud environment supports unlimited endpoints, professional support and a managed infrastructure and it allows you to access and manage this data through its web user interface (WUI) using Kibana.

The amount of data that you will be able to see for the last month is scalable. This is what we name hot storage, the data that you will be able to check through the WUI. However, every alert received during the last 365 days will be retained as cold storage so they remain easily accessible to you.

Each environment will have different requirements. This is why we offer different solutions in terms of tiers.

It might be difficult to set it all at once, in order to get started it is a great way to begin by signing up for a trial and follow the first steps:
