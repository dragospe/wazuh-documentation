  :description: Learn how to get started with Wazuh Cloud Service

Wazuh Cloud Service is a hosted EDR service which offers threat detection, integrity monitoring, incidence response and regulatory compliance among many other features. Wazuh Cloud Console is the convenient way to interact with this service.

Besides these features, a Cloud environment supports unlimited endpoints, offers professional support, a managed infrastructure and allows the user to access and manage its data through the web user interface (WUI) using Kibana.

The amount of data that the user will be able to see for the last month is scalable. This is what we name hot storage, what the user is able to check through the WUI. However, every alert received during the last 365 days will be retained as cold storage, so they still remain easily accessible to you.

Each environment will have different requirements. This is why Wazuh Cloud Service offers different solutions in terms of tiers.

It might be difficult to set it all at once, in order to get started, it is a great way to begin by signing up for a trial and follow the first steps:
