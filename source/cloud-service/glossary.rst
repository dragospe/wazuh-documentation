**Cold Storage (Offline Storage)**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Data containing the output generated by Wazuh such as alerts or archives, and a daily configuration backup. This data will be available to be downloaded within 30 minutes through the Wazuh Cloud API by the user. There is no limit for this data, but alerts and archives will be removed after 365 days and so will backup files after 30 days.
  
**Environment**

The environment is the core of Wazuh Cloud Service. It will both work as a hosted EDR to collect security data and allow its visualization.

**Hot Storage (Online Storage)**

An environment can be set up in different regions such as US east, US west, Europe or Asia Pacific. A region should be chosen according to user's preferences.
